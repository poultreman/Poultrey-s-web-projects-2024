     <ul class="intrests">
        <p>I generally like to play the guitar, and I am currently learning. I have been playing the guitar for about the last 7 years. I have a Brother who I am very close with and about 2 other friends in my friend group. I have a corgy lab mix who's name is Lucy and we have had her for about the last 3 years. One of my favorite musicians is Eve and my favorite song of theirs is Inochi No Tabekata or "How To Eat Life". My favorite song to play on the guitar is a song called Spanish Romance, which has an unknown writer. I generally like watching anime and Playing video games in my free time though I like doing other things too. I like to cook and bake as a hobby but it is also a good life skill to have. I mostly like to cook and bake in the summer because I have a lot of free time then. One of my favorite things to make is my grandmother's stuffing especially since it is so delicious. One of the main things my family values in comedy and I find it a great way to ease a tense situation, cheer people up, or to make up after a fight, its also just a good way to have fun and bond with others. I also like drawing and while I am not the best at drawing or art I am still learning and want to become better at it because I think it is fun and I think it would be fun to learn overall.</p>
